client should give server a file
the file should be family.sri
client loads file and gives to server, then dumps back onto client
^ filecache is for that

Client needs to send a file or message
Client should have all commands in server, but sends message to Server
main file is client
receives messages from server and files

> Client_Stream unix.ucsc.edu
takes you to main

take client_stream.cpp and modify it

Server is always running, never exits/stops?
Each client is on separate thread, takes command String or file String and gives to server
server processes everything

send only takes constant

never have to free const char* because it will always have the same address
^ implies no memory leak

sending "EXIT" to server makes the server quit
